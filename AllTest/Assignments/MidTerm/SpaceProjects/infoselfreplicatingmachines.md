A self-replicating machine is a type of autonomous robot that is
capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials
found in the environment, thus exhibiting self-replication in a
way analogous to that found in nature. The concept of self-replicating
machines has been advanced and examined by Homer Jacobsen, Edward F. Moore,
Freeman Dyson, John von Neumann and in more recent times by K. Eric Drexler
in his book on nanotechnology, Engines of Creation and by Robert Freitas
and Ralph Merkle in their review Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines
which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator
design space. The future development of such technology is an integral
part of several plans involving the mining of moons and asteroid belts
for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even
the construction of solar power satellites in space. The possibly misnamed
von Neumann probe is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann
also worked on what he called the universal constructor, a self-replicating
machine that would operate in a cellular automata environment.
