According to what we know now, black holes output energy
depending on the mass of said black hole. The more mass
it has, the less energy it outputs, but it outputs more
energy overtime. This will not be possible until we further
understand how Hawking Radiation can be harnessed as an
energy source.

The table below represents an approximate energy output and life length
with a black hole with a mass of 1 as a base comparison.

| Black Hole Mass       | Energy Output (*) | Life Length         |
| --------------------- |:-----------------:| -------------------:|
| 2                     | 1/2^2 = 1/4       | 2^3 = 8             |
| 100                   | 1/100^2 = 0.0001  | 100^3 = 1,000,000   |
| .5                    | 1/.5^2 = 4        | .5^3 = 0.125        |
