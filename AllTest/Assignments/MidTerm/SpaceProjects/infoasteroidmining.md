Asteroid mining is the exploitation of raw materials from asteroids and other minor planets, including
near-Earth objects. Minerals and volatiles could be mined from an asteroid or spent comet then used
in space for in-situ utilization (e.g. construction materials and rocket propellant) or taken back to
Earth. These include gold, iridium, silver, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium
and tungsten for transport back to Earth; iron, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, aluminium, and
titanium for construction; water and oxygen to sustain astronauts; as well as hydrogen, ammonia, and
oxygen for use as rocket propellant.
